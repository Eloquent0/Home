          <p>Make a small website about a passion or interest of yours. We'll be using this project as a way to introduce ourselves, as well as a space to practice and experiment writing html and css. An important goal of this project is to allow yourself to experiment and remain flexible with the presentation of the site. Most likely, this is the first site you will be writing by hand — try to let it grow and learn with you!</p>
